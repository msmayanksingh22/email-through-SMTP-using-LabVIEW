# email-through-SMTP-using-LabVIEW

To send email from LabVIEW we used the SMTP blocks namely set message, send mail, SMTP ongoing, open handle, close handle, etc. This feature enables us to generate a mail and send through the lab view interface.
This can be majorly used in computer generated mails so as to reduce human intervention once the whole input data is provided.
